# AES_Algorithm_project

🔐 AES Algorithm – Overview
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST in 2001 and widely used for securing sensitive data. AES encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits) using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is known for its speed, security, and resistance to cryptanalysis.

In this project, Python is used to implement an encryption–decryption system inspired by AES principles, along with scoring metrics to evaluate encryption quality.


🔒 Security Note
While this project demonstrates encryption concepts, it is not a direct AES implementation and should not be used in production for real-world security. For actual AES encryption, use established libraries like PyCryptodome.

📌 Why AES Is Needed
Data Confidentiality – Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Security Standard – Used in banking, government, and corporate systems.

Speed – Efficient for large data sets.

Cross-Platform – Supported in most programming languages and hardware.

🛠 When & How to Use AES
Use AES when:

Storing passwords, tokens, or personal data.

Transmitting sensitive information over the internet.

Securing files, databases, or backups.

Building secure messaging applications.
