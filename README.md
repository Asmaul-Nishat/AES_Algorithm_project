üîê AES Algorithm ‚Äì Python Encryption Project
üìå Overview
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm standardized by NIST in 2001.
It is widely used to protect sensitive data due to its high security and efficiency.

Works on fixed-size blocks of 128 bits

Supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits

This project demonstrates encryption and decryption concepts inspired by AES, implemented in Python.
It also includes a scoring system to evaluate the strength of encryption based on statistical and cryptographic metrics.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a custom encryption demonstration and not a direct AES implementation.
For production, use libraries like PyCryptodome.

‚öôÔ∏è How AES Works (Simplified)
1. Key Expansion
The main key is expanded into round keys.

2. Initial Round
The plaintext is XORed with the initial key.

3. Rounds (10 / 12 / 14 depending on key size)
SubBytes ‚Äì Byte substitution using an S-box

ShiftRows ‚Äì Shifting rows to increase diffusion

MixColumns ‚Äì Mixing data within columns

AddRoundKey ‚Äì XOR with the round key

4. Final Round
Same as above, without MixColumns.

üìÇ Project Structure
1Ô∏è‚É£ Cipher Class ‚Äì Handles Encryption & Decryption
__init__(original_string) ‚Äì Stores the string

encrypt() ‚Äì Reverses string, applies ASCII shifts, inserts random characters

decrypt() ‚Äì Removes inserted characters, reverses ASCII shifts, restores original

2Ô∏è‚É£ Scoring Class ‚Äì Evaluates Encryption Strength
Calculates entropy, frequency variation, encryption consistency

calculate_score() ‚Äì Aggregates weighted scores

generate_summary() ‚Äì Returns metric breakdown

print_results() ‚Äì Displays results in a table
