# AES_Algorithm_project

üîê AES Algorithm ‚Äì Overview
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST in 2001 and widely used for securing sensitive data. AES encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits) using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It is known for its speed, security, and resistance to cryptanalysis.

In this project, Python is used to implement an encryption‚Äìdecryption system inspired by AES principles, along with scoring metrics to evaluate encryption quality.
